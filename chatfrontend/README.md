-------------------------------------------------------------

Create an endpoint (e.g., POST /api/auth/register) that accepts user credentials and stores them securely.
Use ASP.NET Core Identity or JWT for authentication.
Use db for mail address, creation time, last sign in, password (Hash it using bcrypt or Argon2 (never store plain text)), username, guid, (isEmailVerified can be added later on), (2FA can be added later on)

For login use JWT authentication.
